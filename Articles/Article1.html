        <h1>Scope and Abstract Of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <p> <b>Scope and Purpose-</b>A summary is provided of some of the recent (and a few not-so-recent) developments
            that otTer promise for enhancing our ability to solve combinatorial optimization problems. These
            developments may be usefully viewed as a synthesis of the perspectives of operations research and artificial
            intelligence. Although compatible with the use of algorithmic subroutines, the frameworks examined are
            primarily heuristic, based on the supposition that etTective solution of complex combinatorial structures in
            some cases may require a level of flexibility beyond that attainable by methods with formally demonstrable
            convergence properties.</p>
            <p> <b>Abstract-</b>Integer programming has benefited from many innovations in models and methods. Some of the
                promising directions for elaborating these innovations in the future may be viewed from a framework that
                links the perspectives of artificial intelligence and operations research. To demonstrate this, four key areas
                are examined: (1) controlled randomization, (2) learning strategies, (3) induced decomposition and (4) tabu
                search. Each of these is shown to have characteristics that appear usefully relevant to developments on the
                horizon</p>
